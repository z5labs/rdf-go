description: Take the next eligible story issue through the full dev cycle — worktree, implement, test, PR, checks, Copilot review — then label it for GitHub to auto merge.
allowed-tools: Bash, Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, EnterWorktree, ExitWorktree, Monitor, TaskCreate, TaskUpdate
---

Take **exactly one** issue from backlog to a merged PR, then stop. Do not start a second
issue in the same invocation — the loop re-invokes this command for the next one.

You never run `gh pr merge`. You label the PR and GitHub merges it, gated by main's branch
protection; see step 9.

Repo: `z5labs/rdf-go`. Default branch: `main`. Milestone under construction: `v0.2.0`.

## 1. Pick the issue

```
gh issue list --state open --label story --milestone v0.2.0 --limit 100 --json number,title --jq 'sort_by(.number)[]'
```

Always pass `--limit` — the default page size is 30 and this backlog is larger, so
without it eligible issues silently vanish from the list.

Walk the list in ascending number order. For each candidate, read its body
(`gh issue view <n>`) and look at the **Related Issues** section for `Blocked by:` lines
listing `- #N`. An issue is *eligible* only when every issue it lists is CLOSED
(`gh issue view <N> --json state`). Take the lowest-numbered eligible issue.

Dependencies live in the issue body text only. GitHub's native `blocked-by` field is
empty on this repo — do not trust it.

- If no open story issues remain in the milestone, print `BACKLOG EMPTY` and stop.
- If open issues remain but none are eligible, print `BLOCKED` plus which dependency is
  holding things up, and stop.

Read the whole issue body. The **Acceptance Criteria** checklist is the spec — every box
must be genuinely satisfied before you open the PR.

## 2. Worktree

```
EnterWorktree(name: "issue-<n>")
```

This branches fresh from `origin/main`, so previously merged work is present. Confirm with
`git rev-parse --show-toplevel` and `git log --oneline -3`.

`EnterWorktree` and `ExitWorktree` are **unavailable to a subagent running with a
working-directory override** — the tools refuse rather than falling back. When that
happens, use git directly and drive the worktree by absolute path:

```
git fetch origin
git worktree add -b issue-<n> .claude/worktrees/issue-<n> origin/main
```

Branch from `origin/main`, not from local `main`: the main checkout is often behind, since
earlier iterations merge through GitHub rather than locally.

Never commit, branch, or open a PR from the main checkout — the directory holding
`.claude/worktrees/`, which `git worktree list` reports first. Avoid bare `git stash`;
the stash stack is shared across worktrees.

If the repo root has a `CLAUDE.md`, read it now — it holds the implementation conventions
later stories must follow.

## 3. Implement

Work through the acceptance criteria in order. Follow the conventions already established
in the package rather than inventing new ones.

The package layout is **versioned by RDF spec** — confirmed from the issue bodies, do not
flatten it:

- `rdf` (root) — term types shared across both spec versions
- `rdf11/ntriples`, `rdf11/nquads`, `rdf11/turtle`, `rdf11/trig`
- `rdf12/ntriples`, `rdf12/nquads`, `rdf12/turtle`, `rdf12/trig`
- `internal/lex` — shared lexical primitives (#22)
- `iri`, `vocab`

The point of the split is that a graph produced by an `rdf11/*` package can be handed to
an `rdf12/*` printer and back, so the shared term types in `rdf` model RDF 1.2 features
(base direction, `rdf:dirLangString`) even during the 1.1 milestone.

Other conventions:

- Zero third-party runtime dependencies. Do not add a `tool` directive to `go.mod` — it
  leaks into the dependency graph of everyone importing the library.
- Table-driven tests with named subtests, in the style the issues call for.
- Exported identifiers get doc comments starting with the identifier name.
- Cite the grammar production or RFC section that a piece of parsing logic implements.

Write tests alongside the implementation.

## 4. Verify locally

All four must pass before you go further — this is the same set CI runs, so a local
failure is a guaranteed red PR:

```
go build ./...
go vet ./...
go test -race ./...
staticcheck ./...
```

Also run `gofmt -l .` and fix anything it lists.

`staticcheck` must be 2026.1 or newer (`staticcheck --version`). An older build fails with
`module requires at least go1.25, but Staticcheck was built with go1.23` — that is a stale
local binary, not a code defect. Reinstall with
`go install honnef.co/go/tools/cmd/staticcheck@2026.1`.

If a test fails, fix the code — never weaken the test to make it pass. If the acceptance
criteria and a passing test genuinely conflict, stop and report rather than guessing.

## 5. Commit and open the PR

```
git add -A
git commit -m "<type>(<scope>): <summary>"   # match the issue title's prefix
git push -u origin HEAD
gh pr create --title "<issue title>" --body "<body>"
```

The PR body must include `Closes #<n>` so merging closes the issue, the acceptance
criteria checked off one by one, a note on any judgment call that shaped the public API,
and how it was verified. Keep the standard Claude Code attribution. End commit messages
with `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5 <noreply@anthropic.com>`.

## 6. Wait for checks

Do not foreground a `sleep` loop. Either use `gh pr checks <pr> --watch --fail-fast`, or
poll with `Monitor`.

Do **not** use Bash `run_in_background` for a wait loop. It has been observed exiting
immediately without ever polling, which looks like a completed wait and reports whatever
the first sample happened to be. `Monitor` is the tool for any wait in this cycle.

- Exit 0 → green, continue.
- "no checks reported" → CI is missing; investigate rather than treating it as a pass.
  CI landed in #38 and runs on every PR.
- Failure → read the logs (`gh run view <id> --log-failed`), fix, push, and re-watch.
  After **three** failed attempts on the same root cause, stop and report instead of
  looping.

## 7. Request Copilot review

Copilot is a **Bot**, not a User. Two things matter: the login is
`copilot-pull-request-reviewer[bot]`, and passing a bare `reviewers[]=Copilot` to REST
returns 200 while silently doing nothing.

The GraphQL mutation is the reliable path:

```
PR_ID=$(gh pr view <pr> --json id --jq .id)
BOT_ID=$(gh api '/users/copilot-pull-request-reviewer[bot]' --jq .node_id)
gh api graphql -f query='
mutation($pr:ID!, $bot:ID!) {
  requestReviews(input: {pullRequestId: $pr, botIds: [$bot], union: true}) {
    pullRequest { reviewRequests(first:10) { nodes {
      requestedReviewer { __typename ... on Bot { login } } } } }
  }
}' -f pr="$PR_ID" -f bot="$BOT_ID"
```

REST also works on this repo *provided the full bot login is used* — verified on #38 and
#39:

```
gh api --method POST repos/z5labs/rdf-go/pulls/<pr>/requested_reviewers \
  -f "reviewers[]=copilot-pull-request-reviewer[bot]" -q '.number'
```

Either way, confirm the request took by checking that the login appears in
`requested_reviewers`; an empty list means it did not.

Then wait for the review to land. Poll with `Monitor`, not Bash `run_in_background` — see
the warning in step 6:

```
for i in $(seq 1 40); do
  n=$(gh api --paginate repos/z5labs/rdf-go/issues/<pr>/timeline \
        --jq '.[]|select(.event=="reviewed")
              |select(.user.login|test("copilot";"i"))|.id' 2>/dev/null | wc -l)
  if [ "$n" -gt 0 ]; then echo "copilot review landed"; exit 0; fi
  sleep 15
done
echo "copilot review timed out"; exit 1
```

Two filters, both load bearing.

`--paginate`, because the timeline returns thirty events per page by default, and a pull
request that saw several pushes, check runs and comments will push the `reviewed` event off
the first page — where an unpaginated read reports zero and the loop times out on a reviewed
pull request, which is the exact failure this step exists to avoid. Counting `.id` lines
rather than taking a `length` per page is what makes the count work across pages.

The `copilot` login filter, because a `reviewed` event from *anyone* would otherwise end the
wait. The repository owner reviewing a pull request while Copilot was still working would
satisfy this loop, and step 9 would then be deciding on a review that never arrived. The
gate is specifically that Copilot completed; the wait has to be specific in the same way.
Matching is case-insensitive on purpose — the timeline reports this reviewer as `Copilot`
while the `pulls/` endpoints report `copilot-pull-request-reviewer[bot]`.

The wait polls the **timeline**, not `pulls/<pr>/reviews`. The reviews endpoint — and the
equivalent GraphQL query — have been seen returning an empty array for as long as forty
minutes after Copilot had in fact submitted, while the timeline showed it immediately.
Polling the reviews endpoint therefore produces a timeout on a pull request that was
reviewed, and that reads as a missing review rather than as the API lagging.

**Never report `BLOCKED` for a missing review without checking the timeline first:**

```
gh api --paginate repos/z5labs/rdf-go/issues/<pr>/timeline \
  --jq '.[]|select(.event=="reviewed")|select(.user.login|test("copilot";"i"))' \
  | jq -s 'sort_by(.submitted_at)|last|{user:.user.login,state,body}'
```

Same two filters, for the same two reasons — without the login filter this returns whichever
review is newest, which after a human comment is not Copilot's. And `jq -s` because it
slurps the per-page objects back into one array before sorting: sorting inside `--jq` would
sort each page separately and give you the last review *of the last page*, not the last
review.

A non-empty `reviews` array does **not** mean the PR was reviewed. Copilot posts a review
whose body declines the work — most often `"Copilot wasn't able to review this pull request
because it exceeds the maximum number of files (300)"` — and that decline satisfies the
`length > 0` test above. Check the body before treating the review as real:

Read the **most recent** Copilot review only. Reruns and pushed fixes leave older reviews
in the array, so an earlier decline sitting beside a later completed review — or the
reverse — is easy to misread:

```
gh api repos/z5labs/rdf-go/pulls/<pr>/reviews \
  --jq '[.[] | select(.user.login | test("copilot";"i"))]
        | sort_by(.submitted_at) | last | .body // "no copilot review"'
```

A body matching `wasn't able to review` is a **declined** review, not a completed one.
This happened on #57, where the vendored W3C suites pushed the PR past the file limit and
the cycle merged with no review at all.

If the review is declined, times out, or the request itself errors (Copilot review not
enabled for the org), the cycle does **not** merge — see step 9.

## 8. Address review comments

Pull both the summary review and the inline comments — a review with `"generated no
comments"` in its body still counts as having reviewed:

If the reviews endpoint is still lagging (step 7), read the body from the timeline instead —
the `reviewed` events carry the same `state` and `body`. An empty result here is a stale
endpoint, not an absent review.

```
gh api repos/z5labs/rdf-go/pulls/<pr>/reviews --jq '.[] | "\(.user.login) [\(.state)]\n\(.body)"'
gh api repos/z5labs/rdf-go/pulls/<pr>/comments --jq '.[] | "[\(.id)] \(.path):\(.line)\n\(.body)"'
```

Use judgment. Fix what is a real defect or a genuine improvement. Where a comment is wrong
or does not apply, reply on the thread explaining why rather than making the change — do
not silently ignore it and do not change correct code just to clear a comment.

```
gh api --method POST repos/z5labs/rdf-go/pulls/<pr>/comments/<comment-id>/replies \
  -f body="<reply>" -q '.id'
```

The `pulls/<pr>/` segment belongs there. Copilot has claimed on this very file that the
route is `pulls/comments/<comment-id>/replies` and that the form above 404s; it is wrong,
and the reply rebutting it was posted with the command as written. The shorter path is the
`GET`/`PATCH`/`DELETE` route for a single review comment, not the reply route.

If you push fixes, go back to step 6 and let checks re-run before labelling the PR.

## 9. Label the PR for auto merge — never merge it yourself

**Do not run `gh pr merge`.** Not with `--auto`, not without. An agent merging to `main` is
what this whole arrangement exists to avoid: the permission classifier stops it, and a
subagent that merges emits a security banner into its caller's context that blocks the
caller's next agent spawn, killing the loop on its second iteration.

Instead, hand the merge to GitHub by labelling the PR:

```
gh pr edit <pr> --add-label auto-merge
```

`.github/workflows/auto-merge.yaml` picks up the `labeled` event and enables native auto
merge. GitHub squash-merges the PR once every required status check passes — or immediately,
if they have already passed — and leaves it open if one fails.

Apply the label only when **both** hold:

1. Checks are green, and
2. A Copilot review actually **completed** — it either left comments (every one now
   addressed or answered) or reported that it generated none.

This is not a formality to route around: the label **is** the assertion that you verified
both conditions, and adding it without having done so is the same failure as merging
unreviewed work by hand. Required status checks are enforced by main's branch protection
whatever you do; condition 2 is enforced by nothing but you.

Keeping the merge in a workflow puts the policy somewhere it can be read and changed — the
label gate plus the branch protection rule on `main` — rather than in a decision made
mid-cycle and visible only in a transcript. It is also what lets the loop run unattended:
an agent merging to `main` on its own is blocked by permission checks, and labelling is not.

A review that was declined, never arrived, or was never requested because the request
errored is **not** a completed review. In that case do **not** label the PR. Leave it open,
leave the worktree in place, and stop with a report beginning `BLOCKED` that names the PR
and why the review is missing, so the user can tell a PR that needs a human look from one
that merged on its own.

If the PR is unreviewable because it exceeds the 300-file limit, say so in the `BLOCKED`
report and suggest how the work could be split.

Then confirm the label was acted on. There are **two** successful outcomes, and checking
only for an armed auto-merge request will report a false failure on the more common one:

```
gh pr view <pr> --json state,autoMergeRequest -q '"\(.state) \(.autoMergeRequest.enabledAt // "not-armed")"'
```

- `MERGED …` — already merged. `gh pr merge --auto` merges immediately when the required
  checks have already passed, and since this cycle labels only after they pass, this is the
  usual result. `not-armed` beside `MERGED` is correct, not a fault.
- `OPEN <timestamp>` — auto merge is armed and waiting on a check still running.
- `OPEN not-armed` — **usually just means the workflow has not started yet.** The run is
  queued for a few seconds after the label lands, and reading the pull request immediately
  will show this every time. It is not evidence of a failure on its own.

Do not conclude anything from `OPEN not-armed` until the workflow run has actually finished.
The run list is what disambiguates:

```
gh run list --repo z5labs/rdf-go --workflow auto-merge.yaml --limit 1
```

Wait for it to leave `queued` and `in_progress`. A `success` conclusion with the pull
request still open means auto merge is armed and waiting on a check. A `failure` conclusion
means the workflow itself is broken — report it, with the output of
`gh run view <id> --log-failed`, rather than falling back to a manual merge, which is what
this whole step exists to avoid.

## 10. Wait for the merge, then clean up

The merge is asynchronous: labelling queues it, and GitHub completes it when the checks
finish. Wait for it before touching the worktree. Pass the script below as the `command` of
a `Monitor` call — not to Bash with `run_in_background`, which has been observed exiting
immediately without ever polling:

```
for i in $(seq 1 40); do
  s=$(gh pr view <pr> --json state -q .state 2>/dev/null || echo "")
  case "$s" in
    MERGED) echo "PR <pr> MERGED"; exit 0;;
    CLOSED) echo "PR <pr> CLOSED without merging"; exit 1;;
  esac
  sleep 15
done
echo "PR <pr> still OPEN after 10m"; exit 1
```

Both failure paths exit non-zero so an unmerged close or a timeout cannot be mistaken for
success by anything that reads the exit code rather than the emitted line.

If a required check fails, auto merge stays armed and the PR stays open; fix the failure,
push, and it merges when the rerun is green. If it stays `OPEN` with nothing running,
report it rather than merging by hand.

**Never delete the remote branch.** The `delete-merged-branch` job in
`.github/workflows/auto-merge.yaml` owns remote cleanup; leave it to do its job. `git push
--delete` is denied by user settings, and a subagent must not work around that rule. Clean
up only what you created locally: your own worktree and your own local branch (below).

Note that `deleteBranchOnMerge` on the repository does **not** cover this. It fires for a
merge a person performs, not for one the auto merge workflow performs with its
`GITHUB_TOKEN`, which is why that job exists at all. If a branch outlives its merge, the fix
belongs in the workflow, not in a `git push` here.

Once the state really is `MERGED`, one thing the repository normally does on your behalf
will not have happened: a merge performed by the workflow's `GITHUB_TOKEN` does not close
the issue the way a merge performed by a person does. It is not a formality — do it.

**Close the issue.** A `Closes #<n>` line in the pull request body has been observed not
closing it. An issue left open is one the next invocation of this command selects again, so
the loop re-implements work it has already merged:

```
gh issue view <n> --json state -q .state
```

If that says `OPEN`, close it explicitly and say in the comment which pull request did the
work, so the trail is not just a bare state change:

```
gh issue close <n> --repo z5labs/rdf-go --comment "Implemented in #<pr>, merged as <sha>."
```

Re-read the state afterwards and confirm it is `CLOSED` before moving on.

Then drop the worktree:

```
git worktree remove .claude/worktrees/issue-<n>
```

Then bring the main checkout up to date so the next iteration branches from the merged
state, and delete your own local branch. `git worktree list` reports the main checkout
first, so it needs no hard-coded path:

```
git -C "$(git worktree list --porcelain | head -1 | cut -d' ' -f2-)" checkout main
git -C "$(git worktree list --porcelain | head -1 | cut -d' ' -f2-)" pull
git -C "$(git worktree list --porcelain | head -1 | cut -d' ' -f2-)" branch -D issue-<n>
```

A stale *local* branch is what breaks a retry — `git worktree add -b issue-<n>` fails against
an existing branch, and the retry then reports `BLOCKED` on a name collision rather than on
anything real. The remote side needs nothing from you.

If the pull request did not merge, leave the worktree in place and report `BLOCKED` with the
PR number and the last state you saw.

## Report

Finish with a short status: issue number and title, PR number and URL, check result,
whether Copilot reviewed and what it flagged, whether the PR reached `MERGED`, and any
judgment call that shaped the public API. If you stopped early, say exactly where and why —
beginning the report with `BLOCKED`.

## Stop conditions

Stop and report — do not push through — if any of these happen:

- The same CI failure survives three fix attempts.
- Acceptance criteria are ambiguous enough that two readings produce materially different
  public APIs.
- Landing the PR would require a force-push, a branch-protection override, or discarding
  someone else's commits.
- `git status` in the main checkout is dirty with changes you did not make.
- The Copilot review declined, timed out, or was never requested successfully (step 9).

When you stop for one of these, begin the report with `BLOCKED` so the caller can tell a
halted cycle from a finished one at a glance.
